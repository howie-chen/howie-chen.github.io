Rule Name: Write Blog Post
Description: This rule provides guidelines for AI to create or update blog posts in the hexo blog.

1. File Location and Naming:
   - All posts should be created in the `source/_posts/` directory
   - File names should be:
     - All lowercase
     - Words separated by hyphens
     - Meaningful and descriptive in English
     - End with `.md` extension
     - Example: `my-first-blog-post.md`

2. Front Matter Structure:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: Post Title
   date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss
   tags:
     - tag1
     - tag2
   categories:
     - category1
     - subcategory
   ---
   ```

3. Title Guidelines:
   - Should be descriptive and meaningful
   - Can be in English or Chinese depending on the content
   - Use proper capitalization if in English

4. Date Handling:
   - Use system's current date and time
   - Format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss
   - Time zone should match system's timezone
   - Command to get current time: `date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"`
   - Always use the terminal command to ensure accurate system time

5. Tags Guidelines:
   - Use existing tags when applicable
   - Common tags observed in the repository:
     - AI
     - RSS
     - Dev
     - Mac
     - Tools
     - System
   - New tags should be relevant and consistent with existing taxonomy
   - Use lowercase for English tags
   - Multiple tags are allowed

6. Categories Guidelines:
   - Use existing categories when applicable
   - Common categories observed:
     - 信息输入系统 (Information Input System)
     - Development
     - Tools
   - Categories can have hierarchy (parent/child relationship)
   - Use proper capitalization for English categories
   - Chinese categories are allowed

7. Content Structure:
   - Use Markdown formatting
   - Include appropriate headings (##, ###)
   - Use code blocks with language specification when including code
   - Include links to references when applicable
   - Use proper spacing between sections

8. Special Considerations:
   - Ensure all links are valid
   - Include appropriate code formatting for technical content
   - Add relevant images in the correct directory if needed
   - Maintain consistent style with existing posts

9. Content Creation:
   - For new posts, leave the content empty after the front matter
   - Content writing is the responsibility of the human author
   - AI should only create the file structure and front matter

When generating a new post or updating an existing one, the AI should:
1. First scan existing posts to understand the context and taxonomy
2. Generate an appropriate English filename
3. Create proper front matter with current datetime
4. Assign relevant tags and categories based on content and existing taxonomy
5. For new posts, create only the front matter without any content
6. For existing posts, preserve the existing content unless explicitly instructed otherwise
